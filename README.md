# HanaMi: A Healing Lifestyle Journal App.

HanaMi is a lifestyle journaling app that allows users to record the small but important moments in their lives, bringing a bit of light to themselves and someone else in the world.

在生活的起伏中，我們常常忘記了那些微小卻珍貴的時刻，無論是動人的歌聲、一段觸動心弦的對話、或是一次美麗的邂逅，那些曾經帶給我們力量與安慰的事物，都有可能為自己或他人帶來一點亮光。

透過這個app，你可以隨時記錄下生活中的美好，在需要的時候，這些珍藏的回憶與啟發，能成為拉你一把的力量，讓你在最低潮時找到一絲希望，重新看見生活的美好。
